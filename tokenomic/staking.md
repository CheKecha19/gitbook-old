# ðŸ’¸ Staking

Staking rewards period: **2 years**

Formula for calculating daily rewards for NFT staking:

$$
X=((A/B)*C)/D*102739.7
$$

Where:

* X â€“ number of tokens received per day
* A â€“ number of user's NFT
* B â€“ total number of NFTs in the staking
* C â€“ staking coefficient
* D â€“ total coefficient of stakers

Staking coefficient (C):

* 1-2 NFTs â€“ 1
* 3-4 NFTs - 1.05
* 5-6 NFTs - 1.1
* 7-10 NFTs - 1.2

{% hint style="info" %}
Max tokens per day: 102739.7 DCT per user (1 NFT in staking).\
Min tokens per day: 20.55 DCT per user (all supply in staking, all stakers have 1 NFT)
