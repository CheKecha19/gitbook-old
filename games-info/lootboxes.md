# üéÅ Lootboxes

## About:

### **`What is it?` **&#x20;

You have probably seen similar boxes in ~~popular~~ games: buy a box and with some chance, you come across an ordinary, **rare** or **very rare** item. The principle is the same!&#x20;

For a modest fee, you get the opportunity to get **tokens**, like _**SOL**_ or _**DCT**_, or **NFT** from our partner, one of those that we have in stock or one of the popular and expensive collections that are now especially valuable.&#x20;

## Game modes:

### Tokens

#### How many tokens will be in each box?

1. From **0** to **1500 DCT** (Cross-chain)
2. From **0** to **50 SOL** (Solana)
3. From **0** to **50 NEAR** (NEAR)
4. From **0** to **250 USDC** (Etherium)

#### How it works?

Each box will contain certain tokens (SOL/DCT, NEAR/DCT, USDC/DCT). \
When you buy and open a lootbox, you have a chance to win a certain amount of tokens from the list above.

### NFT

#### `How many NFT will be in each box?`&#x20;

**15 NFT**, getting any NFT will be about the same chance: **1/15**.&#x20;

#### How it works?

Initially, each box will contain certain NFTs from a limited list, there will be 3 boxes in total. Then we will combine them into one big loot box once we have enough rare NFTs in our vaults and then you can get not one specific rare NFT but ANY rare NFT for the same price.&#x20;

We will try to find the best price for the box, based on the average price of the rare and common NFTs contained in it. Based on this, the **very** rare NFT you get will give you a **big profit.**
