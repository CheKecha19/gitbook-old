# ðŸŽŸ Lucky tickets

## About:

It's very simple. Buy 1 or more tickets from the general pool, and once the auction is over or all tickets are redeemed, you with a certain probability will receive an NFT or whitelist that will be raffled off in this auction.&#x20;

In our plans: expensive NFTs and whitelists for large projects with serious potential.&#x20;

Our administrators will select prizes for each auction **personally**, and our **DAO participants** will also be able to **choose** which project or NFT will be played **next**

## Game modes:

1. 1/15
2. 1/40
3. 1/100
4. 1/250

## How it works:

You can buy no more than **45%** of the total number of tickets. Number of tickets will be summed up during the distribution of the draw. Chance of winning is defined as:\
$$X/Z$$, where:\
**X** - â€‹number of your tickets\
**Z** - total number of tickets
